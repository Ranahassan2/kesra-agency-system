-- BEFORE UPDATE trigger on public.users enforcing who may change which columns, at the database
-- layer, independent of (and in addition to) the row-level users_update_* RLS policies. RLS alone
-- is row-level, not column-level: users_update_profile_rls/users_update_capacity_rls/
-- users_deactivate_rls all share the same 7-role USING/WITH CHECK predicate
-- (executive/head_of_technical/ai_engineer/the 4 team leads, scoped by employee_visible(id, role)),
-- which means any of those 7 roles can currently set ANY column — including role, auth_id,
-- manager_id, team, or (if it were ever populated) password — on any row employee_visible() lets
-- them touch, via a raw .update({...}) call that bypasses the app's own TS-typed
-- handleUpdateEmployee wrapper entirely (e.g. from browser devtools). This trigger closes that gap
-- at the one place no RLS policy can reach: per-column enforcement within a single UPDATE.
--
-- Audited role list used below (confirmed against the live schema): users_role_check permits all
-- 18 UserRole values, including seo_content_agent and seo_backlink_agent — both are real,
-- insertable/updatable roles today, not a frontend-only aspiration. (An earlier pass at this audit
-- had incorrectly concluded users_role_check was missing these two; corrected here — no migration
-- is needed for the constraint itself.)
--
-- One separate, pre-existing bug remains, NOT fixed by this migration: employee_visible()
-- (20261019000000_ai_engineer_full_application_authorization.sql) grants seo_team_lead visibility
-- into 'seo_agent'/'programming_agent' only — it does not list seo_content_agent/
-- seo_backlink_agent, so a seo_team_lead can't see those rows at all today, even though this
-- trigger (correctly) lets them change role on one once they can see it. This trigger's
-- seo_team_lead agent-set below is written to be correct once employee_visible() is fixed (a
-- separate migration), rather than quietly matching today's narrower, broken visibility.
--
-- Department team-lead -> agent-level-role mapping used below, cross-checked against
-- src/data/roles.ts's TEAM_LEAD_TO_AGENT_ROLE (the frontend's own "single source of truth" for
-- this), employee_visible(), and this request's explicit instruction:
--   am_team_lead            -> am_agent
--   media_buying_team_lead  -> media_buying_agent
--   seo_team_lead           -> seo_agent, programming_agent, seo_content_agent, seo_backlink_agent
--   social_media_team_lead  -> social_media_agent
-- (Note TEAM_LEAD_TO_AGENT_ROLE itself omits programming_agent from seo_team_lead's set, while
-- employee_visible() includes it — an existing inconsistency between the two, not resolved here;
-- this trigger follows the explicit instruction for this migration, which includes it.)
-- executive/head_of_technical/sales/ai_engineer/graphic_designer/video_editor/marketing_manager
-- have no team-lead-held agent-level set of their own (sales/graphic_designer/video_editor have no
-- dedicated lead at all; executive/head_of_technical/ai_engineer sit above every team lead) — a
-- team lead can never move anyone into or out of these roles under rule 4 below.
