-- assignments_update_rls previously only let a department team lead (their own service_type) or
-- the currently-assigned agent (their own row) reassign a service specialist. Leadership
-- (executive/head_of_technical/ai_engineer) could already see every assignment
-- (assignments_select_rls) but had no path to reassign one directly. Per the "head_of_technical
-- must have complete, unrestricted access — overriding restrictions that currently apply even to
-- other leadership roles" rule, add an unconditional leadership bypass alongside the existing
-- department-team-lead/assigned-agent branches, which stay unchanged for everyone else.
