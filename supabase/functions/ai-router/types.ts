//    reset values as DURATION strings ("2m59.56s", "14h12m"), not absolute timestamps.
//  - OpenRouter sends only Limit/Remaining/Reset, and only on an already-rate-limited response —
//    a successful call carries no rate-limit headers at all.
//  - Gemini's REST API does not document per-request rate-limit headers; only `retryAfter` (a
//    generic, widely-used HTTP convention) is opportunistically captured there.
// Turning these into a concrete rate_limited_until timestamp is the Phase 3 router's job, once
// ai_provider_state exists to record it against — per the confirmed policy, provider-reported
// state is the source of truth for availability; this repo's own usage counting is observability
// only, never itself the gate.
